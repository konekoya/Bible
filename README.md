#Offline Bible studay application

This is an application that you can use even when you don't have the Internet connection, for now, we only provide Chinese version. Maybe we will add more languages support down the road.

The original Bible content and code are from http://springbible.fhl.net/OfflineBible/offline.html

#TODO
- improvement on how to show and hide cover text when switch to black screen mode
- music option?
- create a github page for this project
- different theme?
- fallback for font awesome when there's no internet connection - need to fix font awesome path problem
- place setting icon on the nav bar, the machenism should work like YourVersion
- add search functionality
- remove read button and change the select to activate when user finish selecting
- better layout solution for mobile devices
- favicon for this project
- tooltip, and I think we should do a tooltip project...
