#Bible study application

This application is designed specifically for New City Church Sunday gathering.

The original Bible content and codes are from http://springbible.fhl.net/OfflineBible/offline.html

#TODOs
- Reading mode enhancement ideas -- We should work on cancel button(x), it's kind of a distraction when reading mode is on.
- Problem with verse list item, try a different approach to display the verse number. 
- Should have default chapter when opening the app
- Change directories structure, I think we should have a src dir?
- Add sourcemap and JS linting in gulp.js - follow along the Gulp tutorial and improve the development setup
- There are problems that sometimes occur when running Gulp
- Google font fallback if there's no Internet connection
- Fix theme switch issue with Ordered list
- Implement search functionality -- We should come up with something better like built in search feature in browsers
- Remove read button and change the select to activate when user finish selecting
- Better UI and how to select/change between chapters
- Provide higher resolution favicon for Apple products like iPhone and MacBooks
- Chapter field(select) should reflect the current chapter even when user has changed the chapter
- Refactoring the code with OOP manner, and remove inline event binding in index.html
- Rewrite the JS core and remove legacy code which is using old-fashion DOM event binding
- Cross-browser testing, only targeting modern browsers
- Remember progress of the last reading
- Should we use JS testing tools?
- Take a look at this nice browser support chart https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios
- Go back to top button doesn't in IEs...?
- Think about SMACSS and implement it in the current CSS structure

# Browser support
All modern browsers and IE10+
