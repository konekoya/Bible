#An offline Bible studay application

This is an application that you can use even when you don't have the Internet connection, for now, we only provide Chinese version. Maybe we will add more languages support down the road.

Some of the features in this application are designed specifically for our Church use.

The original Bible content and codes are from http://springbible.fhl.net/OfflineBible/offline.html


#TODOs
- fullscreen mode with chrome when click on black mode, check this and see if we can implement this in major browsers - need to think about the mechanism and UX
- scrollbar improvement - make one with vanilla JavaScript, or using plugins for now
- flexbox for the entire layout
- reading mode is needed
- fix black mode issue... the interval function shouldn't fire
- Google font fallback, also we need a solution for CDN resources without internet connection
- testing on the desktop computer of Church to fix RWD and font face issues

- can we use testling? that way we will get a browser testing pass image and then we can put that in the README.md
