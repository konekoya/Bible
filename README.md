#Bible study application

This application is designed specifically for New City Church Sunday gathering.

The original Bible content and code are from http://springbible.fhl.net/OfflineBible/offline.html

#TODOs
- Set up Babel and write ES6!
- a) Remove verse number when copying, this is really annoying b) It would be nice to have a little icon as a hint for copying verses from the page.
- Should have default chapter when opening the app not a blank page...
- Change directories structure, I think we should have a src dir?
- Add sourcemap and JS linting in gulp.js - follow along the Gulp tutorial and improve the development setup
- There are problems that sometimes occur when running Gulp
- Google font fallback is needed if there's no Internet connection avaliable.
- Implement fast search functionality -- like alfred.
- Better UI and how to select/change between chapters
- Retina favicon.
- Chapter field(select) should reflect the current chapter if user has changed the chapter
- Refactoring that legacy codebase...
- Cross-browser testing, only targeting modern browsers.
- Remember progress of the last reading.
- Should we use JS testing tools?
- Take a look at this nice browser support chart https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios
- back to top button is broken in IEs...?
- Think about SMACSS and implement it in the current CSS structure
- Weird undefined text is showing when app initializing
